# captchr

DO NOT INSTALL - captchr is a project to determine who is automatically downloading your gem from rubygems.org

if you download/run/install/instantialize this gem, you are consenting to sending the following information to the authors:
  - hashed_hostname 
  - ruby_version
  - platform
  
we will record this information (along with the IP the request came from) in a local database, so we can conduct analysis on it at a later time. we will never intentionally release the raw dataset.
